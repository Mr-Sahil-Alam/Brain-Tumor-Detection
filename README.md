# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project aims to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of brain tumors in MRI scans. The CNN model is designed to analyze and classify brain images as either tumor-present or tumor-absent, assisting medical professionals in accurate and timely diagnosis.

Features:

Dataset Collection: The project utilizes a curated dataset of MRI brain scans, comprising images with and without tumors.

Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to enhance image quality and ensure compatibility with the CNN model.

CNN Architecture: A state-of-the-art CNN architecture is implemented to extract meaningful features from brain MRI images.

Model Training: The CNN is trained on the preprocessed data to learn tumor patterns and optimize its performance.

Validation: The model's accuracy is evaluated using various metrics and cross-validation techniques.

Inference: The trained CNN is used to predict tumor presence in new, unseen MRI images.

Visualization: Visualizations of model predictions and feature maps are provided to aid in understanding the decision-making process.
