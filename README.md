# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project aims to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of brain tumors in MRI scans. The CNN model is designed to analyze and classify brain images as either tumor-present or tumor-absent, assisting medical professionals in accurate and timely diagnosis.
